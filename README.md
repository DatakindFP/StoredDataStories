# StoredDataStories
Materials (code &amp; data) for the ODSC West 2019 workshop: 'From Stored Data To Data Stories: Building Data Narratives With Open-source Tools'

## Why *data narratives*?  
+ **Scenario** The machine learning campaign is nearing its conclusion. Data has been collected and curated. Features have been engineered. Multiple models have been built and evaluated.
+ Now it's time to communicate the details, conclusions, and actionable insights that are consequences of the machine learning campaign.  
+ There are multiple audiences: fellow data scientists who are as interested in the mechanics of the machine learning campaign as they are in the outcome; data engineers who might be tasked with putting the models into production; managers and customers whose main interest is in the outcome, and how the results might be utilized.  
+ The purpose of a data narrative is communication, *e.g.,* a **notebook** that mixes code, text, results, figures, and explanations into one seamless document; an **HTML** page; a **document** suitable for publication.  
+ During this workshop attendees will start with tabular dataframes, build classification and regression models, document the model building process, and prepare presentations (slides) and documents (PDF) that describe the machine learning campaign. We'll demonstrate how one body of code can be used to prepare notebooks, slides, and documents. There will be an emphasis on tools and techniques that produce well-crafted tables, figures, and plots.
